# Flyber Data Strategy - Udacity Data Product Manager Nanodegree

Flyber, the first flying taxi service in New York City has been massively successful. The original data pipelines to receive and process the customer events are unable to keep up. We have been tasked to come up with a data strategy to not only handle this massive amount of data but also process it to get the business insights they need to run and grow their business.
In this project we will:

* Identify primary data stakeholders and their data needs.
* Understand how data can be modeled or organized to support data business needs.
* Perform ETL.
* Choose relevant data sets to answer business questions.
* Optional Create visualizations to understand the scale of data growth.
* Analyze data to address Flyber's Data Growth Rate.
* Choose Data Infrastructure strategy for Flyber.
